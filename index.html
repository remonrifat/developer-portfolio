        <p>My name is Rimon sadir Rifat Every freelancer has had to tackle the ever-dreaded “professional summary.” Now,
            we’re not talking about the “About Me” page on your website, nor are we referring to your LinkedIn bio. The
            professional summary is a beast of its own—and an increasingly popular one at that, especially on the many
            new platforms aimed at matching freelancers with work opportunities. It’s what you’ll get asked for
            countless times by mentors, former bosses, and other professional contacts when they offer to forward on
            your resume or portfolio. </p>
